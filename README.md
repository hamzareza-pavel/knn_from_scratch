# Implementation of K Nearest Neighbors algorithm from scratch 
The algorithm was evaluated with different distance matrics such as Euclidean, Manhattan, Hamming, and Minkowski distance after implementation. Feel free to play around and add your own distance metric. 
To run the algorithm and evaluate the algorithm you can use the following datasets:

1. [Hayes Roth](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/44/hayes+roth)
2. [Car Evaluation](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/19/car+evaluation)
3. [Breast Cancer](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/14/breast+cancer)
